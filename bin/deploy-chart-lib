# hack to check for error in the response and fail CI/CD if found.
# the curl command sends the file to chartmuseum which we get from the env
# it pipes the output to tee, which usually outputs to stdout AND a file, but this is a hack to output then pipe instead of write a file
# then it pipes to a shorthand conditional. If we see "error" in stdin, grep succeeds. If not it fails.
# We then look at that with && and ||.
# && means that we DID find error in stdin, so we fail the pipeline with exit 1
# || means that we DID NOT find error in stdin, so we pass the pipeline with exit 0
